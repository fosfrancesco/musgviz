# Music Graph Visualizer
Visualize graphs on musical scores. Simply clone the repo, open the [index.html](index.html) file in a browser (we used Chrome for developing) and load the JSON file and the MEI score.

Examples of JSON graph files are available in the `static` folder.
The exact file specifications will be made available in a future release.
